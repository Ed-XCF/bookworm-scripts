# bookworm-scripts
The series of shell scripts are intended to build a pretty clean Debian 12.

Within the installer.sh file, you can choose to install the following window managers:
* bspwm
* dk 
* dwm
* qtile
* i3

Uncomment the lines in the bash script to enable installation.

With regard to other scripts:
* custom.sh - installs my current configurations for all window managers.
* discord-install.sh - installs the newest discord quickly from the current binary files.
* lapce.sh - installs the alpah version of the Lapce text editor.  
* ly.sh - installs the ly console manager (careful if you already have lightdm installed)
* neovim.sh - neovim in the Debian packages is somewhat dated.  This installs the newest from github.
* orchis.sh - installs some gtk themes and icons for your gui.
* thunderbird_install.sh - installs the newest thunderbird on Debian.
